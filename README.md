Hello there, my name is Michael Mogor.
I am currently enrolled in a Software Development Bootcamp course.
I am hoping to become a full-stack Web Developer one day.
I am starting my very first project in February 2022 & hope to be finished by end of April 2022.
So far, I am well versed in HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
I hope to be competent in Python and React, one day. I plan on implementing both of these frameworks, into my project, as I progress.
