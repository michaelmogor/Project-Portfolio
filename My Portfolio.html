    <div class="About">
    <p><h3>Hello, my name is Michael Mogor</h3> <br>
    I am currently studying Software Engineering with the Bath Spa Web Development Bootcamp course. <br>
    I am, absolutely, enjoying the course & I have learned so much, already, in such a short space of time. <br>
    Thus far, I have leatned how to use HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I am also currently working on incorporating additional frameworks such as HTML 5 <br> (for HTML), Flexbox & Bootstrap (for CSS) and Python & React (for JavaScript). <br>
    In the next few to come, I strive to become a Full-Stack <br> Web developer, as I would love to, eventually, getting into more Server-Side <br> development. <br>
    As for the meantime, mastering the front-end development of a <br> website is truly an enjoyable past-time for me. Hopefuly, gainfull employment <br> will soon be on the cards. <br>
    I will be uploading my progress to GIT Hub as to showcase my work and to, also, practise my skills with website interactivity. <br>
    I strive to impress.
